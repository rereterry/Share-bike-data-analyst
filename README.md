Goals of Exploratory Data Analysis

get a general sense of the data
data-driven (model-free)
visual (Humans are great pattern recognizers)
test assumptions (e.g. normal distributions or skewed?)
identify useful raw data & transforms (e.g. log(x))
distributions (symmetric, normal, skewed)
data quality problems
outliers
correlations and inter-relationships
subsets of interest
suggest functional relationships

use data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset
